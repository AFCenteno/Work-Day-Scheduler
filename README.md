Link to app: https://mrafcent1.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

This program allows you to add important events to a daily planner so you can manage your time effectively.

The schedule runs from 9AM to 5PM

As time progresses the time alloted info box changes color based on whether the time has already passed (grey), the time is now (red), and the time is in the future (green).
